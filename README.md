# Predicting Drug usage to reduce the cancer cell growth by 50%
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/Y3X_UAzXCmM>
#### Description:

1) This Project is on predicting ic50 size which is coined in cancer research and used by doctors to calculate correct dosage of drugs to reduce the cancer growth cell by 50%

2) I have flask website made which contains a **Session** folder which is used to keep track of current session. In **app.py** I have all the logic for backend development of the website which includes how am I going to process the uploaded data and how to send it to machine learning model and get the output file(which contains the predictions made by ML model) in a downloadable format on the website

3) In **Templates** Folder I have all the html files with a main file "Layout.html" using Jinja to parent on other html files

4) There is a **Machine.ipynb** File contains the Machine Learning model which is then passed by the the file path of the uploaded data and that creates a clone ML model with that file path and proccesses the data. The cloned ML model is stored in **output** folder

5) In the **uploads** Folder it contains all the files uploaded by the user on the website

6) In the **prediction** Folder it contains the predicted csv file generated by the machine learning model which doctors can use.
